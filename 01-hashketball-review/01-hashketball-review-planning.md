- explain "Flipped Classroom":  We expect you to see the material before lecture (although not master)

- emphasize asking questions, feeling stupid, saying "I don't know"

- Don't code along unless instructed to

- Video and code made available after lecture

- rspec; rspec --fail-fast
    - can run a specific file: `spec/rspec hashketball_spec.rb`
    - or a specific test: `spec/rspec hashketball_spec.rb:29`

- Programmers are lazy, by design

- Don't cut and paste, both for understanding and for muscle memory

- TDD

- Don't do too much at once--tight feedback loop.  Success is often defined as a new error.

- My data is set up differently:  Players are an array of hashes as opposed to one hash with player names as keys
